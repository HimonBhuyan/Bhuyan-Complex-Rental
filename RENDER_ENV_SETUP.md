# 🔒 SECURE EMAIL SETUP FOR RENDER

## Add These Environment Variables in Render Dashboard:

### Go to Render → Your Web Service → Environment Tab

**Add these 2 variables:**

**Variable 1:**
- **Key:** `BREVO_API_KEY`
- **Value:** `[Your Brevo API Key from above]`

**Variable 2:**
- **Key:** `BREVO_EMAIL`
- **Value:** `complexbhuyan@gmail.com`

**Click "Save Changes" to deploy.**

## ✅ What Will Happen:
- Render will auto-deploy with new environment variables
- System will detect Brevo and switch from test mode
- Tenants will receive real emails in their Gmail/Outlook inboxes
- Logs will show: "🚀 Using Brevo for real email delivery"

## 🔍 Verify Success:
Check Render logs after deployment for:
```
🚀 Using Brevo for real email delivery
📧 Brevo sender: complexbhuyan@gmail.com
✅ Email service connection verified successfully
```

## 🚨 If Still Having Issues:
The authentication error might need a few minutes to resolve after sender verification. If it persists, we can quickly switch to Resend (simpler alternative).

**Your sender email is verified ✅, so this should work now!**
